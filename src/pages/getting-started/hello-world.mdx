# Hello, World!

Let's write and execute a smart-contract on Cardano in 10 minutes. Yes, you read
that well.

## Pre-requisites

We'll use `Aiken` to write the script, and
[`Lucid`](https://github.com/spacebudz/lucid) to construct and submit the
transaction. So make sure you have your dev environment ready for some
TypeScript (we recommend installing
[deno](https://deno.land/manual@v1.29.1/getting_started/installation)) and have
Aiken installed already.

If you haven't any public/private key pair available, you'll also need the
[`cardano-cli`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/tree/master/cardano-cli#cardano-cli)
to generate some credentials.

## Scaffolding

First, let's create a new `Aiken` project:

```
aiken new hello_world
cd hello_world
git init
```

This command scaffolds an Aiken project. In particular, it creates a `lib` and `validators` folders in which you can put Aiken source files.

```
./hello_world
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ aiken.toml
â”œâ”€â”€ lib
â””â”€â”€ validators
```

## Using the standard library

We'll use the [standard library](https://aiken-lang.github.io/stdlib) for writing our validator. So let's download it as part of our project:

```
curl -s https://codeload.github.com/aiken-lang/stdlib/zip/refs/heads/main --output - | tar -C lib --strip-components 2 -xf - "stdlib-main/lib/*"
```

This commands download the standard library into the `lib/` folder to make it available for our script to use.

<Callout>
Downloading dependencies is still a bit _clunky_ at the moment, but worry not, this will be integrated to the Aiken command-line soon. But for now, bear with it a little.
</Callout>

## Our first validator

Let's write our first validator as `validators/hello_world.ak`:

```aiken filename="validators/hello_world.ak"
use aiken/list
use aiken/string
use aiken/hash.{Blake2b_224, Hash}
use aiken/transaction.{ScriptContext}
use aiken/transaction/credential.{VerificationKey}

pub type Datum {
  owner: Hash<Blake2b_224, VerificationKey>,
}

pub type Redeemer {
  msg: ByteArray,
}

pub fn spend(datum: Datum, redeemer: Redeemer, context: ScriptContext) -> Bool {
  let must_say_hello = string.from_bytearray(redeemer.msg) == "Hello, World!"
  let must_be_signed =
    context.transaction.extra_signatories
    |> list.any(fn(vk) { vk == datum.owner })

  must_say_hello && must_be_signed
}
```

Our first validator is rudimentary. It is parameterized by a `VerificationKey` that is set when funds are sent to the contract. To be unlocked, the spender must provide a signature of the corresponding `SigningKey` of the whole transaction. In a way, it mimics the traditional public/private key signing mechanism that are common to blockchains.

It's now time to build our first contract.

```
aiken build
```

This generate a few assets in the `assets` folder. In particular, we can find a `script.cbor` that contains our compiled `hello_world` spending validator.

```
assets
â””â”€â”€ hello_world
    â””â”€â”€ spend
        â”œâ”€â”€ mainnet.addr
        â”œâ”€â”€ payment_script.json
        â”œâ”€â”€ script.cbor
        â””â”€â”€ testnet.addr
```

Let's see it in action!

## Getting funds

Before moving one, we'll need some funds, and a public/private key pair to hold them. We can create a new keypair using the `cardano-cli` via:

```
cardano-cli address key-gen --normal-key \
  --verification-key-file key.vk \
  --signing-key-file key.sk
```

Then, we'll need to make an address from our verification key to receive some test funds from the faucet. We can also use the `cardano-cli` for that:

```
cardano-cli address build \
  --testnet-magic 2 \
  --payment-verification-key-file key.vk \
  > key.addr
```

This creates an address for the `preview` test network, and stores it in `key.addr`. Now, we can head to [the Cardano faucet](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnet/tools/faucet) to get some funds on the preview network to our newly created address. Make sure to select _"Preview Testnet"_ as network.

Using [CardanoScan](https://preview.cardanoscan.io/) we can watch for the faucet sending some ADA our way. This should be pretty fast.

## Using the contract

Now that we have some funds, we can lock them in our newly created contract. We'll use [`Lucid`](https://github.com/spacebudz/lucid) to construct and submit our transaction through Blockfrost.

<Callout type="info">
  This is only one example of possible setup using tools we love. For more tools, make sure to check out the [Cardano Developer Portal](https://developers.cardano.org/tools)!
</Callout>

### Setup

First, we setup Lucid with Blockfrost as a provider. This will allow us to let Lucid handle transaction building for us, which includes managing changes. It also gives us a direct way to submit the transaction later on.

```ts filename="hello-world.ts"
import {
  Blockfrost,
  C,
  Constr,
  Data,
  Lucid,
  SpendingValidator,
  TxHash,
  fromHex,
  fromhex,
  toHex,
} from "https://deno.land/x/lucid@0.8.2/mod.ts";
import * as cbor from "https://deno.land/x/cbor@v1.4.1/index.js";


const lucid = await Lucid.new(
  new Blockfrost(
    "https://cardano-preview.blockfrost.io/api/v0",
    /* BLOCKFROST API KEY */,
  ),
  "Preview",
);

const privateKey = await readPrivateKey("key.sk");

lucid.selectWalletFromPrivateKey(privateKey.to_bech32());

const validator = await readValidator("./assets/hello_world/spend/script.cbor");


// --- Supporting functions

async function readPrivateKey(filepath: String): Promise<C.PrivateKey> {
  const str = JSON.parse(await Deno.readTextFile(filepath)).cborHex;
  return C.PrivateKey.from_normal_bytes(fromHex(str.substr(4)));
}

async function readValidator(filepath: String): Promise<SpendingValidator> {
  return {
    type: "PlutusV2",
    script: toHex(cbor.encode(fromHex(await Deno.readTextFile(filepath)))),
  };
}
```

<Callout>
  If you've installed [deno](https://deno.land/manual@v1.29.1/getting_started/installation), you can run the excerpt above by executing:

  ```
  deno run --allow-net --allow-read hello_world.ts
  ```

  It assumes that this file (`hello_world.ts`) is placed at the root of your `hello_world` folder. At this stage, your folder should looks roughly like this:

  ```
  ./hello_world
  â”‚
  â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
  â”œâ”€â”€ aiken.toml
  â”œâ”€â”€ assets
  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ hello_world
  â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ spend
  â”‚Â Â          â”œâ”€â”€ script.cbor
  â”‚Â Â          â””â”€â”€ ...
  â”œâ”€â”€ hello_world.ts
  â”œâ”€â”€ key.addr
  â”œâ”€â”€ key.sk
  â”œâ”€â”€ key.vk
  â”œâ”€â”€ lib
  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ ...
  â””â”€â”€ validators
   Â Â  â””â”€â”€ hello_world.ak
  ```
</Callout>

### Locking funds into the contract

Here, we make our first transaction to lock funds into the contract. The datum
must match the representation expected by the script, so this is a constructor
with a single field that is a byte array.

As value for that byte array, we provide a hash digest of our public key. This
will be needed to unlock the funds.

```ts filename="hello-world.ts"
const datum = Data.to(new Constr(0, [privateKey.to_public().hash().to_bytes()]));

const txLock = await lock(1000000, { into: validator, owner: datum });

await lucid.awaitTx(txLock);

console.log(`1 ADA locked into the contract
    Tx ID: ${txLock}
    Datum: ${datum}
`);

// --- Supporting functions

async function lock(lovelace, { into, owner }): Promise<TxHash>{
  const contractAddress = lucid.utils.validatorToAddress(into);

  const tx = await lucid
    .newTx()
    .payToContract(contractAddress, { inline: owner }, { lovelace })
    .complete();

  const signedTx = await tx
    .sign()
    .complete();

  return signedTx.submit();
}
```

Now is a good moment to pause and have a look at CardanoScan. Here's [an example of an _Hello World_ transaction](https://preview.cardanoscan.io/transaction/8559f57234407204d8e9a6bf57ef6943c65ec7119eb1c2ca6224f8bad8e71c1e?tab=utxo) that we generated using this tutorial.

If you notice the small icon next to the contract output address, we can even [inspect the datum](https://preview.cardanoscan.io/datumInspector?datum=d8799f581c10073fd2997d2f7dc6dadcf24966bd06b01930e5210e5de7aebf792dff):

```json filename="d8799f581c10073fd2997d2f7dc6dadcf24966bd06b01930e5210e5de7aebf792dff"
{
   constructor: 0,
   fields: [
      {
         bytes: "10073fd2997d2f7dc6dadcf24966bd06b01930e5210e5de7aebf792d"
      }
   ]
}
```

### Unlocking funds from the contract

Finally, as a last step: we now want to spend the UTxO that is locked by our
`hello_world` contract.

To be valid, our transaction must meet two conditions:

- it must provide "Hello, World!" as a redeemer; and
- it must be signed by the key referenced as datum (i.e the owner).

<Callout type="warning">
  Note that we need to explicitly add a signer using `.addSigner` so that it gets
  added to the `extra_signatories` of our transaction -- and becomes accessible
  for our script.
</Callout>

```ts filename="hello-world.ts"
const utxo = { txHash: txLock, outputIndex: 0 };

const redeemer = Data.to(new Constr(0, [new TextEncoder().encode("Hello, World!")]));

const txUnlock = await unlock(utxo, { from: validator, using: redeemer });

await lucid.awaitTx(txUnlock);

console.log(`1 ADA recovered from the contract
    Tx ID: ${txUnlock}
    Redeemer: ${redeemer}
`);

// --- Supporting functions

async function unlock(ref, { from, using }): Promise<TxHash> {
  const [utxo] = await lucid.utxosByOutRef([ref]);

  const tx = await lucid
    .newTx()
    .collectFrom([utxo], using)
    .addSigner(await lucid.wallet.address())
    .attachSpendingValidator(from)
    .complete();

  const signedTx = await tx
    .sign()
    .complete();

  return signedTx.submit();
}
```

And, tada ðŸŽ‰!

We can inspect our [redeeming transaction in CardanoScan](https://preview.cardanoscan.io/transaction/d3d5e828a3989691b0960d22a265c8c9ae4723134b52aa05ec0fb7d40f060392?tab=contracts) and see that it successfully executed our _Hello World_ contract.
